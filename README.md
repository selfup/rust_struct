# README

### My first real attempt at learning rust.

Learning how to borrow values and increment them

Building some very basic movement logic

Learned how to test. Will find convention for taking test out of main file!

### To run:

```cargo build```

```cargo test```

```cargo run```

### Disclaimer

This is mostly test driven code. There are no plans for a CLI or GUI on this repo :P
