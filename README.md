# README

### My first real attempt at learning rust.

Building Tron Game (Light Cycles) logic in rust.

Tests provided in ```main.rs```

### To run:

```git clone https://github.com/selfup/rust_struct.git && cd rust_struct```

```cargo build```

```cargo test```

```cargo run```

### Disclaimer

This is mostly test driven code. There are no plans for a CLI or GUI on this repo :P

### TODO:

1. Add another bike
2. Combine both bike positions into a master array
3. Iterate the array 2 elements at a time and compare
4. Implement collision detection
